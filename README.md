Mustache for Dart
=================
A simple implementation of [Mustache][mustache] for the [Dart language][dart]. 
At the moment this project serves as an excuse to better explore the language. 
Although it is still in development you can have a look at what is capable of 
at the [tests][tests]

Using it
--------
In order to use the library, just add it to your pubspec.yalm as a dependency

	dependencies:
	  mustache4dart: any

and you are good to go. You can use the render toplevel function to render your template.
For example:

	var salutation = render('Hello {{name}}!', {name: 'Bob'});
	print(salutation); //shoud print Hello Bob!

### Compiling to functions
If you have a template that you are going to reuse with different contextes you can compile
it to a function using the toplevel function compile:

	var salut = compile('Hello {{name}}!');
	print(salut('Alice')); //should print Hello Alice! 

Running the tests
-----------------
[![Build Status](https://drone.io/github.com/valotas/mustache4dart/status.png)](https://drone.io/github.com/valotas/mustache4dart/latest)
At the moment the project is under heavy development but pass all [Mustache specs][specs]. 
If you want to run the tests yourself, the following commands should be enough

	git clone git://github.com/valotas/mustache4dart.git
	git submodule init
	git submodule update 
	pub install
	test/run.sh
